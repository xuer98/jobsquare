"""ICF Mock 1 -- ContentStore. Fill in every method; do not change the signatures.

HOW TO USE THIS FILE
--------------------
This skeleton contains **Level 1 only**. That is deliberate: the exam is timed
level by level, and seeing the later levels early would give away the design.

When you finish a level, go back to `PROBLEM.md` and read the next one. Each
level lists its own method signatures -- copy them into your class yourself and
implement them there. Nothing is pre-stubbed for you beyond Level 1, exactly as
in the real CodeSignal editor, where the next level's methods only appear once
you have submitted the current one.
